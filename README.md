Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)
LIRI sounds like iPhone's SIRI but its a little different. SIRI responds to speach while LIRI responds with a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

## What LIRI does
LIRI is a node application that searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movie data. This powerful application displays the results quickly in your terminal/commands prompt.

### How it works
liri.js takes in one of the following commands:
* `concert-this`
* `spotify-this-song`
* `movie-this`
* `do-what-it-says`

Examples

* `node liri.js concert-this` (enter artist or band name here)
* `node liri.js spotify-this-song` (song name here)
* `node liri.js movie-this` (enter movie name here)
* `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

Your input should look like this

* `node liri.js concert-this Lady gaga`

### How to get started
1. After downloading, run *npm install*
2. Run the program from your terminal to see how powerful LIRI is
